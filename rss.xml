&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Show valid feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable the switch style checkbox we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox

      name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;check-button&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show multiply disabled checkbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add multiple disable form checkboxes we are going to use props &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;option&lt;/code&gt; array of objects with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; props with boolean value &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Using options array:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
        id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checkbox-group-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;selected&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;options&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;options&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;flavour-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Selected&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; selected &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Sunday&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;sunday&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add multiple checkboxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add multiple choice checkboxes using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show valid feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Using options array:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For multiple checkboxes, we are going to use the checkbox group options array, and for these two &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-form-group&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-form-checkbox-group&lt;/code&gt; components we are going to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;option&lt;/code&gt; props. the option can be string, array, or object Available fields are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/code&gt; The selected value which will be set on v-model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Disabled&lt;/code&gt; Disables item for selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; Display text, or HTML Display basic inline HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Using options array:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
        id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checkbox-group-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;selected&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;options&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;options&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;flavour-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Selected&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; selected &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;selected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Monday&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;monday&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Tuesday&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;tuesday&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Friday&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;friday&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Sunday&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;sunday&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sortoutcode/sortoutcode-images/main/bootstrap-vue-normal-multiple-checkboxes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;bootstrap vue form&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Using sub-components:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For multiple checkboxes in the sub-component, we are going to manually place &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; inputs that will appear below the checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/code&gt; generated by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; prop. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Using sub-components:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
        id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checkbox-group-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;selected&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;flavour-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add multiple checkboxes with an options array using BootstrapVue.We are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-form-checkbox&lt;/code&gt; component to show the checkbox and for multiple checkboxes, we are using the checkbox group options array. For that, we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;option&lt;/code&gt; props.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you add multiple checkboxes with an options array using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add multiple checkboxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add multiple checkboxes with an options array using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add multiple checkboxes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the multiple checkboxes we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For multiple checkboxes, we are going to use the checkbox group options array, and for these two &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-form-group&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-form-checkbox-group&lt;/code&gt; components we are going to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;option&lt;/code&gt; props. the option can be string, array, or object Available fields are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/code&gt; The selected value which will be set on v-model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Disabled&lt;/code&gt; Disables item for selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; Display text, or HTML Display basic inline HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Using options array:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
        id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checkbox-group-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;selected&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;options&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;options&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;flavour-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Selected&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; selected &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add multiple checkboxes with sub-components in BootstrapVue.We are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-form-checkbox&lt;/code&gt; component to show the checkbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you add multiple checkboxes using sub-components using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add multiple checkboxes using sub-component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add multiple checkboxes using sub-components using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add multiple checkboxes using sub-component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For multiple checkboxes in the sub-component, we are going to manually place &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; inputs that will appear below the checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/code&gt; generated by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; prop. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Using sub-components:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
        id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checkbox-group-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;selected&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;flavour-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox value&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;monday&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Monday&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox value&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;tuesday&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Tuesday&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox value&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;friday&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Friday&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add multiple button style checkbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; uses the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add multiple button-style checkboxes we are going to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; props and an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; array of items.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add inline multiple checkboxes using BootstrapVue.We are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-form-checkbox&lt;/code&gt; component to show the checkbox. To add multiple checkboxes with an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; array of options for multiple checkboxes. And to inline the multiple checkboxes, we are going to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; props with an options array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you add inline multiple checkboxes using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Add inline multiple checkboxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add inline multiple checkboxes using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add inline multiple checkboxes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add multiple checkboxes with an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; array of options for multiple checkboxes. And to add inline the multiple checkboxes we are going to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; props with an options array. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
      label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Inline switch style checkboxes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;slot&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;{ ariaDescribedby }&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
        v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;selected&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;options&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;options&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;aria&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;describedby&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;ariaDescribedby&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        inline
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

And to inline the multiple button checkbox we are going to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; props with an options array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you add inline multiple button style checkboxes using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add inline multiple button style checkbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add multiple button style checkboxes we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; props with an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; array of options for multiple checkboxes. And to add inline the multiple button checkboxes we are going to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; props with an options array. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
      label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Inline switch style checkboxes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;slot&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;{ ariaDescribedby }&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
        v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;selected&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;options&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;options&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;aria&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;describedby&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;ariaDescribedby&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        buttons
        inline
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Selected&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; selected &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Show valid feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add checkbox valid feedback validation using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show valid feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For work with the form, we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component in BootstrapVue.To add some structure to forms we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. To pair the form control, with a legend or label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; prop of the form group component in BootstrapVue.Bootstrap includes validation styles for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;valid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;invalid&lt;/code&gt; states on most form controls. If we want to use the state particular state for a specific type of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; denotes the invalid state. This is great when we want to block or show the required field
A user must fill in this field properly to submit the form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; denotes the valid state. This is ideal for situations when you have per-field validation throughout a form and want to encourage a user through the rest of the fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; Displays no validation state neither valid nor invalid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show the invalid feedback we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;form-valid-feedback&lt;/code&gt; props in the form group component. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
      v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;options&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;options&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;state&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;state&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checkbox-validation&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show invalid feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For work with the form, we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component in BootstrapVue.To add some structure to forms we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. To pair the form control, with a legend or label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; prop of the form group component in BootstrapVue.Bootstrap includes validation styles for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;valid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;invalid&lt;/code&gt; states on most form controls. If we want to use the state particular state for a specific type of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; denotes the invalid state. This is great when we want to block or show the required field
A user must fill in this field properly to submit the form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; denotes the valid state. This is ideal for situations when you have per-field validation throughout a form and want to encourage a user through the rest of the fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; Displays no validation state neither valid nor invalid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show the invalid feedback we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;form-invalid-feedback&lt;/code&gt; props in the form group component. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group
      v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;options&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;options&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;state&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;state&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checkbox-validation&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;invalid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;feedback &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;state&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;state&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Please select three days&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;invalid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;feedback&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add an autofocus switch checkbox using BootstrapVue.We are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-form-checkbox&lt;/code&gt; component to show the checkbox. We going to use the autofocus button style checkbox using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;autofocus&lt;/code&gt; props.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you add an autofocus switch checkbox using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add autofocus in the switch style checkbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add an autofocus switch checkbox using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add autofocus in the switch style checkbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the autofocus in the button style checkbox we are going to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;autofocus&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

We going to use the autofocus button style checkbox using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;autofocus&lt;/code&gt; props.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you add autofocus in the checkbox using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Add autofocus in the checkbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add autofocus in the checkbox using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add autofocus in the checkbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the autofocus in the button style checkbox we are going to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;autofocus&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox
      v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;status&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      value&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checked&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      unchecked&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;not_checked&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      autofocus
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Sortoutcode
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;State&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; status &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;not_checked&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add an autofocus button style checkbox using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add autofocus in button style checkbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the autofocus in the button style checkbox we are going to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;autofocus&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checked1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;check-button&quot;&lt;/span&gt; button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      sortout &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Checked&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; checked1 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checked2&quot;&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;check-button&quot;&lt;/span&gt; button button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;variant&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;info&quot;&lt;/span&gt; autofocus&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Sortoutcode &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Checked&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; checked2 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;checked1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add a single checkbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the checkbox we are going to use the form checkbox &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. these components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-checkbox&gt;&lt;/code&gt; use the bootstrap custom checkbox input to replace the browser default checkbox input.so it is a solid replacement for the default checkbox input. We are going to set the checkbox value using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-modal&lt;/code&gt;, for the chacked value we are going to set &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value=&quot;checked&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and for unchacked &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;unchecked-value=&quot;not_checked&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox
      v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;status&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      value&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;checked&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      unchecked&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;not_checked&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Sortoutcode
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;checkbox&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;State&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; status &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;strong&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get input value using the v-modal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component we are adding some structure to the form. Its purpose is to add the form control with a label and to provide help text and invalid/valid feedback text, as well as visual (color) contextual state feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are going to get the value of form input using the v-modal &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-model=&quot;sitename&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in BootstrapVue.And save the input value into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sitename&lt;/code&gt; Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system.

In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Change the label text size with the form group component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component we are adding some structure to the form. Its purpose is to add the form control with a label and to provide help text and invalid/valid feedback text, as well as visual (color) contextual state feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can change the label text size which matches the size of your form input(s). For that, we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;label-size&lt;/code&gt; props. Values can be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sm&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;lg&lt;/code&gt; for the small or large labels, respectively. Sizes work for both horizontal and non-horizontal form groups. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sitename with label small size&quot;&lt;/span&gt; label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;size&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sm&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;input v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sitename&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add description prop with a form group component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component we are adding some structure to the form. Its purpose is to add the form control with a label and to provide help text and invalid/valid feedback text, as well as visual (color) contextual state feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the description to the input tag, we going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add label prop with a form group component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component we are adding some structure to the form. Its purpose is to add the form control with a label and to provide help text and invalid/valid feedback text, as well as visual (color) contextual state feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the label we going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Enter your name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;input v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sitename&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sitename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reset the form component data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For work with the form, we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component in BootstrapVue.To add some structure to forms we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. To pair the form control, with a legend or label. And for submitting the form data we going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@submit&lt;/code&gt; event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reset the form component data we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@reset&lt;/code&gt; event. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add form component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add a form component using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add form component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For work with the form, we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component in BootstrapVue.To add some structure to forms we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-form-group&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. To pair the form control, with a legend or label. And for submitting the form data we going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@submit&lt;/code&gt; event. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;how you install ReactJS application globally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with a project example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React is one of the most popular javascript libraries. In the web development field today there are also other popular javascript libraries like VueJS, AngularJS, etc. React is a javascript framework that is built for user interfaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a front-end developer, I have worked with React in my projects and probably will continue to work with it in the future. When newcomers start learning React they struggle with the installation/configuration process of React &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start with the basics. In this post, we are going to install and Run the React application easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the ReactJS framework installation, there are some pre-requirement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Node.js&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you install the React application?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How to Download &amp;#x26; Install Node.js &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to Install Create-React-App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the App Created with Create-React-App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will guide you to &lt;strong&gt;How do I install the React application?&lt;/strong&gt; with an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Download &amp;#x26; install Node.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we are going to need NPM (or Yarn, alternatively). Let’s use NPM for this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For installing node.js, go to node.js official website and download the current version of node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node.js is, allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the nodejs application from the official website &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot;&gt;Node. js&lt;/a&gt;.
which also includes NPM (Node Package Manager).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the download is complete, install the Node in your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation is complete, we are going to check what is a version of Node. For this, we are going to start our terminal/command prompt and run the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm -v&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;node -v&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your version of NPM should be at least 5.2.0 or newer because create-react-app requires that we have NPX installed. If you have an older version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v5.2.0&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt;, run this command to update it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install -g npm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Install Create-React-App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For installing the React application, we open our workspace (desktop or a folder) and run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npx create-react-app sortoutcode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sortoutcode&lt;/code&gt; is our project name. The installation process may take a few minutes. After it is done, you should see a folder that appears in your workspace with the name you gave to your app which is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sortoutcode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show disabled dropdown item&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to show the disabled dropdown item we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; props in BootstrapVue.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Select City&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-md-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mumbai&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Kolkata&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item disabled&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Delhi&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Kerala&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Split the dropdown button using BootstrapVue.To split the dropdown button we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; props in BootstrapVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you split the dropdown button using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add split prop to the dropdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I split the dropdown button using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add split prop to the dropdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to split the dropdown menus button we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; prop. The split button left side will provide the button with a standard click event and the Left side will provide a dropdown toggle button. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown split id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-dropleft&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;50&quot;&lt;/span&gt; text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Select City&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show collapse visible from start using BootstrapVue.We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-collapse&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component for adding the toggle collapse in BootstrapVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you show collapse visible from start using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially show collapse visible &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I show collapse visible from start using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initially show collapse visible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding toggle collapse we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-collapse&lt;/code&gt; component. Visibility can be easily toggled with our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-b-toggle&lt;/code&gt; directive. Toggle the visibility of the container we are using the &lt;strong&gt;id&lt;/strong&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visible the collapse from the start, we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;visible&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;toggle&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&apos;first&apos;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Toggle Collapse&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;collapse visible id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;first&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mt-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show active dropdown item&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to show the active drop-down item we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; props in BootstrapVue.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Select City&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-md-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mumbai&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Kolkata&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item active&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Delhi&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Kerala&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toggle collapse using v-model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding toggle collapse we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-collapse&lt;/code&gt; component. Visibility can be easily toggled with our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-b-toggle&lt;/code&gt; directive. Toggle the visibility of the container we are using the &lt;strong&gt;id&lt;/strong&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visible the collapse we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-model&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Different props example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add different props of the dropdown using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Different props example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the example of all other props:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Add simple dropdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Select City&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-md-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mumbai&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Kolkata&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Delhi&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/sortoutcode-images/bootstrap-vue-dropdown.gif&quot; alt=&quot;bootstrap vue dropdown&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Add divider in dropdown item&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the divide the dropdown’s item we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-divider&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component. Which use as a divider/spacer which can be used to separate dropdown items. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to add the content to the dropdown button we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;button-content&lt;/code&gt; in BootstrapVue.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;button-content&lt;/code&gt; slot allows us to add the basic HTML tag with the icon in the button content. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to alight the dropdown menu we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; props. The dropdown menu can either be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; aligned (default) or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; aligned concerning the button above it. To have the dropdown aligned on the right, we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sortoutcode/sortoutcode-images/main/bootstrap-vue%20offset%20dropdown%20menu.gif&quot; alt=&quot;bootstrap vue offset dropdown menu&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. Add split prop to the dropdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to split the dropdown menus button we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; prop. The split button left side will provide the button with a standard click event and the Left side will provide a dropdown toggle button. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;13. Add dropdown button size&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to add the different dropdown button sizes. we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; props and the value of props are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sm,md,lg&lt;/code&gt;.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;14. Add dropdown color variant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to add the different dropdown color variants. we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;variant&lt;/code&gt; props and its value is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;success, primary, info, danger, link, outline-dark&lt;/code&gt; etc. for the dropdown color variant in BootstrapVue. And the default variant color is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;secondary&lt;/code&gt;.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you offset the dropdown menu using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add offset to the dropdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I offset the dropdown menu using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the app.js` file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add offset to the dropdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to show the dropdown menu’s list offset from the button a bit. For that, we going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt; props of BootstrapVue.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-dropleft&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;80&quot;&lt;/span&gt; text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Select City&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mumbai&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To disable the tab use BootstrapVue.We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component to add tabs and to disable the tab we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; props in BootstrapVue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disable the tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. And for disabling the tab we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card no&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tabs card pills end&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; This is the first tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab disabled title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Second tab with more content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; This is the Second tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toggle collapse using the value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding toggle collapse we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-collapse&lt;/code&gt; component. Visibility can be easily toggled with our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-b-toggle&lt;/code&gt; directive. Toggle the visibility of the container we are using the &lt;strong&gt;id&lt;/strong&gt; value like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-b-toggle=&quot;&apos;first&apos;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;toggle&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&apos;first&apos;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Toggle Collapse&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you add custom dropdown button text using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add text props in the dropdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add custom the dropdown button text using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add button content in the dropdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to add the content to the dropdown button we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; in BootstrapVue.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; slot allows us to add the basic HTML tag with the icon in the button content. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Button text via Prop&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-md-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mumbai&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Kolkata&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toggle the visibility using the modifiers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding toggle collapse we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-collapse&lt;/code&gt; component. Visibility can be easily toggled with our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-b-toggle&lt;/code&gt; directive. Toggle the visibility of the container we are using the &lt;strong&gt;id&lt;/strong&gt; modifiers like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-b-toggle. first&lt;/code&gt;.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trigger multiple collapse elements using BootstrapVue.We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-collapse&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component for adding the toggle collapse in BootstrapVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you trigger multiple collapse elements using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trigger multiple collapse element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I trigger multiple collapse elements using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trigger multiple collapse element&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding toggle collapse we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-collapse&lt;/code&gt; component. Visibility can be easily toggled with our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-b-toggle&lt;/code&gt; directive. Toggle the visibility of the container we are using the &lt;strong&gt;id&lt;/strong&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trigger the multiple collapse element, we are going to use a single &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-b-toggle&lt;/code&gt; directive with the multiple target IDs using modifiers. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;toggle&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;first&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;second&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Toggle Collapse&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;collapse id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;first&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mt-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To turn the dropdown menu into a drop-left menu using BootstrapVue.We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dropleft&lt;/code&gt; prop to turn the dropdown menus into drop-left menus in BootstrapVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you turn the dropdown menu into a drop-left menu using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add drop-left menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I turn the dropdown menu into a drop-left menu using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-install-vue-bootstrap-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add drop-left menu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to turn the dropdown menu into drop-left menus we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dropleft&lt;/code&gt; props of BootstrapVue.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-dropleft&quot;&lt;/span&gt; dropleft text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Drop-left&quot;&lt;/span&gt; variant&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;primary&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mumbai&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add drop-right menu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to turn the dropdown menu into drop-right menus we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dropright&lt;/code&gt; props of BootstrapVue.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-dropright&quot;&lt;/span&gt; dropright text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Drop-right&quot;&lt;/span&gt; variant&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;primary&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mumbai&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Kolkata&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Kerala&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remove default fade effect from tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. If we want to remove the default fade effect from the tabs changes then we have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;no-fade&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tabs content&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mt-3&quot;&lt;/span&gt; no&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;fade&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apply classes to the active tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. If we want to apply classes to the currently active control or tab then we have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;active-nav-item-class&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;active-tab-class&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tabs active&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;nav&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text-uppercase text-success&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          active&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text-danger&quot;&lt;/span&gt; content&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mt-3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Righthand side vertical tabs controls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. If we want to create righthand side vertical tabs controls then we have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vertical&lt;/code&gt; props and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card no&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tabs card pills vertical end&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lefthand side vertical tabs controls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. If we want to create lefthand side vertical tabs controls then we have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vertical&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card no&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Second tab with more content&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add toggle collapse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding toggle collapse we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-collapse&lt;/code&gt; component. Visibility can be easily toggled with our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-b-toggle&lt;/code&gt; directive. Toggle the visibility of the container we are using the &lt;strong&gt;id&lt;/strong&gt; value. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;toggle&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;first&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Toggle Collapse&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;collapse id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;first&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mt-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Align the tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. If we want to align the tab so we have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;align&lt;/code&gt; props and the value should be the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;left, right, and center&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s check the center example align for that we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;align=&quot;center&quot;&lt;/code&gt; props:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tabs align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;center&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; This is the first tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Second&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s check the output of the center alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s check the example for right align for that we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;align=&quot;right&quot;&lt;/code&gt; props:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add block level split dropdown button&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding dropdown button size we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to add the block level split dropdown button. By default the dropdown act like an inline dropdown button. To create, the block-level split dropdown button we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown block split split&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;variant&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;success&quot;&lt;/span&gt; id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Select City&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-md-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create equal width tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. If you want to create a tab that is equally the same width control. you should use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;justified&lt;/code&gt; props. All horizontal space will be occupied by the controls, but unlike using the fill above, every control will be the same width. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tabs justified&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; This is the first tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add a split button color variant in the dropdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding dropdown button size we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to add the different split button color variants in the dropdown. we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;split-variant&lt;/code&gt; props and its value is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;success, primary, info, danger, link, outline dark&lt;/code&gt; etc. for the split button color variant in the dropdown in BootstrapVue. And the default variant color is secondary`.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown split split&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;variant&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;success&quot;&lt;/span&gt; id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Select City&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-md-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mumbai&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a full available width tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. If you want to create a tab that takes proportionately fill all available space with your tab controls. you should use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; props. It will take all the available space horizontally. You can see that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; props will take all the space, but not all tab control has the same width. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tabs fill&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; This is the first tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add active the tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. And for active the tab, we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tabs content&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mt-3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; This is the first tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Second&quot;&lt;/span&gt; active&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; This is the Second tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;third&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add dropdown color variant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding dropdown button size we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to add the different dropdown color variants. we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;variant&lt;/code&gt; props and its value is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;success, primary, info, danger, link, outline-dark&lt;/code&gt; etc. for the dropdown color variant in BootstrapVue. And the default variant color is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;secondary&lt;/code&gt;.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add dropdown button size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding dropdown button size we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to add the different dropdown button sizes. we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; props and the value of props are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sm,md,lg&lt;/code&gt;.Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add pills tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. And for adding the pills style variant tab we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pills&lt;/code&gt; props style variant. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add a split button link in the dropdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to add the dropdown button link we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;split-href&lt;/code&gt; props. The split dropdown on the left side defaults to a button type. To convert this button into a link or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;router-link&gt;&lt;/code&gt; we specify the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;split-href&lt;/code&gt; props or router link &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; value via the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;split-to&lt;/code&gt; props, while maintaining the button look. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown split split&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;href&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Split Dropdown With link&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mumbai&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Card integration in tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. And for card integration in the tab, we are going to just add the card property to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and placed it inside the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-card&lt;/code&gt; component. We are going to add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;no-body&lt;/code&gt; props on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-card&lt;/code&gt; component to remove the extra CSS. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card no&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add a basic tab with content using BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add basic tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding a basic tab with content we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-tab&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tabs content&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mt-3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt; active&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tab title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Second&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dropdown menu left and right align&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to alight the dropdown menu we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; props. The dropdown menu can either be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; aligned (default) or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; aligned concerning the button above it. To have the dropdown aligned on the right, we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add dropdown button content in the dropdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to add the content to the dropdown button we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;button-content&lt;/code&gt; in BootstrapVue.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;button-content&lt;/code&gt; slot allows us to add the basic HTML tag with the icon in the button content. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-md-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template #button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;content&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              This is &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;List&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;City&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add divider in dropdown item&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the divide the dropdown’s item we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-divider&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component. Which use as a divider/spacer which can be used to separate dropdown items. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add a simple dropdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adding the dropdown we are using the BootstrapVue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-dropdown&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying the links. This button is toggled by clicking or pressing space or enter when focused. And the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-dropdown-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sub-component will show the action items that provide click, link functionality. This will work as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. In short, Renders is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element by default. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dropdown-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Select City&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;m-md-2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mumbai&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;dropdown&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the vue-typeahead-bootstrap package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&lt;/code&gt; package into our app. we have to use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm i vue-typeahead-bootstrap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to globally register the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&lt;/code&gt; in main.js&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; App &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./App.vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; BootstrapVue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; IconsPlugin &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap-vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; VueTypeaheadBootstrap &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap-vue/dist/bootstrap-vue.css&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;BootstrapVue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;IconsPlugin&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Global registration&lt;/span&gt;
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; VueTypeaheadBootstrap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;config&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;productionTip &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;App&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add autocomplete component in your app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the VueTypeaheadBootstrap in our app. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;pl-1 pb-2 pt-3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Selected Country&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; query &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the vue-typeahead-bootstrap package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&lt;/code&gt; package into our app. we have to use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm i vue-typeahead-bootstrap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to globally register the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&lt;/code&gt; in main.js&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; App &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./App.vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; BootstrapVue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; IconsPlugin &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap-vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; VueTypeaheadBootstrap &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap-vue/dist/bootstrap-vue.css&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;BootstrapVue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;IconsPlugin&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Global registration&lt;/span&gt;
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; VueTypeaheadBootstrap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;config&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;productionTip &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;App&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add autocomplete component to your app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the VueTypeaheadBootstrap in our app. And also we are going to call the event after the value is selected from the autocomplete. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;pl-1 pb-2 pt-3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Selected Country&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; selected &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;Options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;optionData&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;vue&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;typeahead&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bootstrap 
                        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;optionData&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the vue-typeahead-bootstrap package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&lt;/code&gt; package into our app. we have to use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm i vue-typeahead-bootstrap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to globally register the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&lt;/code&gt; in main.js&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; App &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./App.vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; BootstrapVue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; IconsPlugin &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap-vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; VueTypeaheadBootstrap &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap-vue/dist/bootstrap-vue.css&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;BootstrapVue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;IconsPlugin&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Global registration&lt;/span&gt;
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue-typeahead-bootstrap&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; VueTypeaheadBootstrap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;config&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;productionTip &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;App&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add autocomplete component to your app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the VueTypeaheadBootstrap in our app. And also we are going to call an event when entering the value of autocomplete. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;6&quot;&lt;/span&gt; offset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;pl-1 pb-2 pt-3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Enter Data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; enterData &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;Options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;optionData&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;vue&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;typeahead&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;bootstrap 
                        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;optionData&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the autocomplete in vuejs. we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vuejs-auto-complete&lt;/code&gt; package. We are going to see how to set up and how to use this package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you add a static object with the autocomplete in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the vuejs-auto-complete package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add autocomplete component to your app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add a static object with the autocomplete in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the vuejs-auto-complete package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vuejs-auto-complete&lt;/code&gt; package into our app. we have to use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm i vuejs-auto-complete&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation is complete, we have to add Autocomplete component to our app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add autocomplete component in our app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the autocomplete component in our app. We are going to define the static array of objects, and show it in the autocomplete values. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;width:800px; margin:0 auto;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;autocomplete 
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;source&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;color&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;autocomplete&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Autocomplete &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vuejs-auto-complete&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    Autocomplete
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Red&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Green&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Yellow&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the vuejs-auto-complete package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vuejs-auto-complete&lt;/code&gt; package into our app. we have to use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm i vuejs-auto-complete&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation is complete, we have to add Autocomplete component to our app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add autocomplete component in our app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the autocomplete component in our app. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;width:800px; margin:0 auto;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;autocomplete 
          source&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
          results&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;property&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          results&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;display&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;full_name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;autocomplete&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Autocomplete &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vuejs-auto-complete&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    Autocomplete
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the vuejs-auto-complete package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vuejs-auto-complete&lt;/code&gt; package into our app. we have to use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm i vuejs-auto-complete&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation is complete, we have to add Autocomplete component to our app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add autocomplete component in our app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the autocomplete component in our app. And also we are going to call the event after the value is selected from the autocomplete. Let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;width:800px; margin:0 auto;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;autocomplete &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;source&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;color&quot;&lt;/span&gt; @selected&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;showSelected&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;autocomplete&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; id &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; name &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Autocomplete &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vuejs-auto-complete&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;toggle modal using the ref attribute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to toggle the modal using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; attribute. We can access the modal using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; attribute and then call the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;toggle()&lt;/code&gt; method to show/hide the modal in BootstraVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modal with different footer button size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can set the footer button size other than the default button size. By setting the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;button-size&lt;/code&gt; prop to &lt;strong&gt;sm&lt;/strong&gt; for small buttons, or &lt;strong&gt;lg&lt;/strong&gt; for larger buttons. Let’s see the example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click sm&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click lg&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;modal-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt; button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;size&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sm&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hi everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a vertically centered modal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to show the modal vertically centered by setting the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;centered&lt;/code&gt; props to modal. Let’s see the example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click Here&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;modal-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; centered title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hi everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a scrollable modal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes content is too big so it scrolls the viewport and app to show. In BootstrapVue you don’t have to scroll the whole page to read the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By setting the prop &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scrollable&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you can allow the modal to scroll the modal body. Let’s the example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;modalShow&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click Here&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;modalShow&quot;&lt;/span&gt; scrollable title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-4&quot;&lt;/span&gt; v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;i in 5&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;i&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummied text &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; the printing and typesetting industry&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&apos;s
          standard dummy text ever since the 1500s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; when an unknown printer took a galley &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; type and scrambled it to
          make a type specimen book&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; It has survived not only five centuries&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; but also the leap into electronic
          typesetting&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; remaining essentially unchanged&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; It was popularised &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; the 1960s &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; the release &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; Letraset
          sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; and more recently &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; desktop publishing software like Aldus
          PageMaker including versions &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; Lorem Ipsum&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Modal with scrolling long content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the model is too long for the user to read in their user’s viewport or device, they can scroll the page independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the v-model property&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to show/hide the modal using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-model&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-model&lt;/code&gt; property is automatically synced with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-modal&gt;&lt;/code&gt; visible state and we can show/hide the modal using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-model&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Show/Hide modal using the ref attribute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to show and hide the modal using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; attribute. We can access the modal using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; attribute and then call the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;show()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hide()&lt;/code&gt; methods to show/hide the modal in BootstraVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;show-btn&quot;&lt;/span&gt; @click&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;showModal&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click Here&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hide/Show modal using $bvModal object&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are installing the BootstrapVue plugin or the &lt;strong&gt;ModalPlugin&lt;/strong&gt; plugin is used, BootstrapVue will inject the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$bvModal&lt;/code&gt; object into every Vue instance(component, app).there is several methods of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.$bvModal&lt;/code&gt;.From that method we are going to use these two method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.$bvModal.show(id)&lt;/code&gt; -   Show the modal with the specified &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.$bvModal.show(id)&lt;/code&gt; -   Show the modal with the specified &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SecondComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;show-btn&quot;&lt;/span&gt; @click&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;$bvModal.show(&apos;bv-modal&apos;)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Open Modal&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bv-modal&quot;&lt;/span&gt; title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt; hide&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;footer&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;d-block text-center&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hi everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add a modal to the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use modal in our vue project. we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-modal&lt;/code&gt; component. By default in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-modal&lt;/code&gt; has OK and Cancel buttons in the footer. To add the modal heading we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can override the modal title via the named slot &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;modal-title&lt;/code&gt;, override the header completely via the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;modal-header&lt;/code&gt; slot, and override the footer completely via the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;modal-footer&lt;/code&gt; slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;modal-footer&lt;/code&gt; slot, the default &lt;strong&gt;OK&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Cancel&lt;/strong&gt; buttons will not be preset. And when you are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;modal-header&lt;/code&gt; slot then the default header &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; close button will not be present, nor can you use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;modal-title&lt;/code&gt; slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the default modal example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container fluid&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click Here&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;modal-1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hi everyone&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;my-4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;modal&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder. the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and imported into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add color picker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as mentioned above, Now let’s start today’s tutorial, To set the color picker we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-form-input&lt;/code&gt; component. For the color picker, we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; props. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-form-input&lt;/code&gt; defaults to a text input, But there are different supported native browser HTML5 types which are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;text, password, email, number, URL, tel, search, date, DateTime, DateTime-local, month, week, time, range&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an alternative option for using to color picker that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vue-colorpicker &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v-color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the tutorial, we are going to use the props &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;type=&apos;color&apos;&lt;/code&gt; with color type. Let’s understand through the example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add b-spinner component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s main topic, just as mentioned above I am going to add the spinner to our application. For that, I am going to use the BootstrapVue component which is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-spinner&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different props defined in the BootstrapVue of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-spinner&lt;/code&gt; component which is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;label, role, small, tag, type, variant&lt;/code&gt;.Let’s take a simple example of a spinner component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;spinner&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;spinner&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Show the b-icon component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After vue-bootstrap installation and setup, I’m going to show you How to use the icon in BootstrapVue, as mentioned above here, I’m going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b-icon&lt;/code&gt; component on vue-bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial on how do you add bootstrap icons in BootstrapVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mt-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;icon icon&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;gear-fill&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;icon&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;icon icon&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;person-fill&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;icon&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;icon icon&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;inbox-fill&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;icon&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create Card With &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BootstrapVue we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the card. Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Let’s see the example of a card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Card Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; consectetuer adipiscing elit&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To Sortoutcode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To divide two numbers in vue.js, use the / operator it will divide if your value datatype is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; else if your value datatype is a string first convert it using Number() and then perform the division operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following example, we will take the sample numbers, and strings and perform a division operation using the / division operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To Sortoutcode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To subtract two numbers in vue.js, use the - operator it will subtract if your value datatype is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; else if your value datatype is string first convert it using Number() and then perform the subtraction operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following example, we will take the sample numbers, and strings and perform a subtraction operation using the - subtraction operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subtracting Two numbers example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; num1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; num2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
num2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; num1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; num1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;20&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; num2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;25&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;num2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;num1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the vue.js project setup, I’m going to show you How do subtract two numbers in vuejs, as mentioned above here, I’m going to use the - subtraction operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial on how do you subtract two numbers in vue.js?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we will do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take an example of a number and string number data() function&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To Sortoutcode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add two numbers in vue.js, use the + operator it will add if your value datatype is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; else if your value datatype is a string first convert it using Number() and then perform the addition operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following example, we will take the sample numbers, and strings and perform an addition operation using the + addition operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding Two numbers example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; num1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; num2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
num2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; num1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding Two string numbers example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; num1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;20&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; num2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;25&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;num2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;num1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, which will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the vue.js project setup, I’m going to show you How to add two numbers in vuejs, as mentioned above here, I’m going to use the + addition operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial on how do you add two numbers in vue.js?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we will do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create Card With &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BootstrapVue we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the card. Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Let’s see the example of a card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Card Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create Card With &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BootstrapVue we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the card. Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Let’s see the example of a card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Card Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create Card With &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BootstrapVue we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the card. Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Let’s see the example of a card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Card Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; consectetuer adipiscing elit&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button href&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;#&quot;&lt;/span&gt; variant&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;primary&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Go somewhere&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add Titles, text, and links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the card &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; we are useing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; props and and for the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sub-title&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sub-title&lt;/code&gt; props.This &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is rendered using the sub-component named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card-title&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and for the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sub-title&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; render using sub-component named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card-sub-title&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.With sub-component &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card-title&gt;&lt;/code&gt; while the Sub Title is rendered using the sub-component &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card-sub-title&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.And Link can be added using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.card-link&lt;/code&gt; class and also we can use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-link&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component.Let’s see the example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create Card With &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BootstrapVue we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the card. Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Let’s see the example of a card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Card Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disable the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card-body&gt;&lt;/code&gt; section&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are creating a card using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.This &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card-body&gt;&lt;/code&gt; section provides a padding section within the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt; content is automatically placed in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card-body&gt;&lt;/code&gt; section which provides the padding section with the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card-body&gt;&lt;/code&gt; section, we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;no-body&lt;/code&gt; props. Let’s see the example of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;no-body&lt;/code&gt; props:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Card Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt; no&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;card&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create Card With &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BootstrapVue we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-card&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the card. Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Let’s see the example of a card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the list component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List group components are flexible and powerful for displaying the series of content. We are using the List group component to create our list in BootstrapVue.List Group items can be modified to support just about any content within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to set the active item from the list. you have to pass the &lt;strong&gt;active&lt;/strong&gt; props to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-list-group-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to indicate the currently active item. let’s see the example of an active item from the listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add contextual &lt;strong&gt;variants&lt;/strong&gt; props for style to item from listing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the contextual variants to style the item from the list. you have to pass the &lt;strong&gt;variant=“primary”&lt;/strong&gt; props to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-list-group-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to make it.To set contextual &lt;strong&gt;variants=&quot;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; to style the item of Bootstrap listing. let’s see the example of variants to an item from the listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contextual variants also work with the actional link to items of listing. In the actionable item, it shows an extra hover effect to BootstrapVue.And on the click, it set it to indicate an active selection on a contextual list group item. let’s see the example of variants to an item from the listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the list component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List group components are flexible and powerful for displaying the series of content. We are using the List group component to create our list in BootstrapVue.List Group items can be modified to support just about any content within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create the list component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List group components are flexible and powerful for displaying the series of content. We are using the List group component to create our list in BootstrapVue.List Group items can be modified to support just about any content within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the list component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List group components are flexible and powerful for displaying the series of content. We are using the List group component to create our list in BootstrapVue.List Group items can be modified to support just about any content within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Aguidehub&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Infinitbility&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Test&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add contextual &lt;strong&gt;variants&lt;/strong&gt; props for style to item from listing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the contextual variants to style the item from the list. you have to pass the &lt;strong&gt;variant=“primary”&lt;/strong&gt; props to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-list-group-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to make it.To set contextual &lt;strong&gt;variants=&quot;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; to style the item of Bootstrap listing. let’s see the example of variants to items from the listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contextual variants also work with the actional link to items of listing. In the actionable item, it shows an extra hover effect to BootstrapVue.And on the click, it set it to indicate an active selection on a contextual list group item. let’s see the example of variants to an item from the listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create the list component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List group components are flexible and powerful for displaying the series of content. We are using the List group component to create our list in BootstrapVue.List Group items can be modified to support just about any content within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;set &lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt; props to an item from listing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the button to item from the list. you have to pass the &lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt; props to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-list-group-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to make it set the clickable to the item of Bootstrap listing.let’s see the example of a button to item from listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the list component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List group components are flexible and powerful for displaying the series of content. We are using the List group component to create our list in BootstrapVue.List Group items can be modified to support just about any content within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Aguidehub&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Infinitbility&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Test&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;set &lt;strong&gt;href&lt;/strong&gt; props item from listing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the actionable link to an item from the list. you have to pass the &lt;strong&gt;href=&quot;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; props to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-list-group-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to make it set the actionable link to the item of the Bootstrap listing.let’s see the example of an actionable item from the listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the list component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List group components are flexible and powerful for displaying the series of content. We are using the List group component to create our list in BootstrapVue.List Group items can be modified to support just about any content within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Aguidehub&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Infinitbility&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Test&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;set &lt;strong&gt;disabled&lt;/strong&gt; item from listing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the disabled item from the list. you have to pass the &lt;strong&gt;disabled&lt;/strong&gt; props to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-list-group-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to make it appear disabled item.let’s see the example of a disabled item from the listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the list component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List group components are flexible and powerful for displaying the series of content. We are using the List group component to create our list in BootstrapVue.List Group items can be modified to support just about any content within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Aguidehub&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Infinitbility&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Test&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;set the &lt;strong&gt;active&lt;/strong&gt; item&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to set the active item from the list. you have to pass the &lt;strong&gt;active&lt;/strong&gt; props to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-list-group-item&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to indicate the currently active item. let’s see the example of an active item from the listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item active&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Aguidehub&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;list&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;group&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the list component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List group components are flexible and powerful for displaying the series of content. We are using the List group component to create our list in BootstrapVue.List Group items can be modified to support just about any content within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;row&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;col md&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;let’s check the examples of bootstrap-vue table export to excel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Register &lt;strong&gt;JsonExcel&lt;/strong&gt; to vue entry point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to register the &lt;strong&gt;JsonExcel&lt;/strong&gt; package to vue entry point. Then we can use the package in our component template. To register the package you can use this code in your main.js file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; JsonExcel &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue-json-excel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;downloadExcel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; JsonExcel&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;download-excel&lt;/strong&gt; to your template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;strong&gt;download-excel&lt;/strong&gt; code to your template And pass the props &lt;strong&gt;:data=“items”&lt;/strong&gt; data and value of the props should be your table data array of objects. In this example, we are passing the props value &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the file type you can pass the props that is &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt; and value of the props should &lt;strong&gt;csv or xls&lt;/strong&gt; like this  &lt;strong&gt;type=“csv,xls”&lt;/strong&gt;.You can pass the file type just as you need. you can follow the code below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;download&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;excel &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt; type&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;csv&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mb-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Export To Excel&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Install the &lt;strong&gt;vue-json-excel&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register &lt;strong&gt;JsonExcel&lt;/strong&gt; to vue entry point &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;let’s check the examples of bootstrap-vue table export to excel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Aguidehub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://aguidehub.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://infinitbility.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Inactive&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table striped hover &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Register &lt;strong&gt;JsonExcel&lt;/strong&gt; to vue entry point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to register the &lt;strong&gt;JsonExcel&lt;/strong&gt; package to vue entry point. Then we can use the package in our component template. To register the package you can use this code in your main.js file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; JsonExcel &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue-json-excel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;downloadExcel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; JsonExcel&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;download-excel&lt;/strong&gt; to your template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;strong&gt;download-excel&lt;/strong&gt; code to your template And pass the props &lt;strong&gt;:data=“items”&lt;/strong&gt; data and value of the props should be your table data array of objects. In this example, we are passing the props value &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the excel filename you use another prop that is &lt;strong&gt;name=“filename.xls”&lt;/strong&gt;. you have to set the file name with an extension. you can see the code below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;download&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;excel &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mb-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Export To Excel&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;download&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;excel&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table striped hover outlined &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the &lt;strong&gt;Export To Excel&lt;/strong&gt; button before the table, this table data is exported to excel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Register &lt;strong&gt;JsonExcel&lt;/strong&gt; to vue entry point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to register the &lt;strong&gt;JsonExcel&lt;/strong&gt; package to vue entry point. Then we can use the package in our component template. To register the package you can use this code in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; JsonExcel &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue-json-excel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;downloadExcel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; JsonExcel&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;download-excel&lt;/strong&gt; to your template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;strong&gt;download-excel&lt;/strong&gt; code to your template And pass the props &lt;strong&gt;:data=“items”&lt;/strong&gt; data and value of the props should be your table data array of objects. In this example, we are passing the props value &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt;. For the Custom heading we are using the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; props and passing the object name &lt;strong&gt;:fields=“fields”&lt;/strong&gt;.In the Fields object, the key of the object is our custom header label, we won’t set our excel header like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;No, Website Name, Website Link and Website Status&lt;/code&gt;, and value of the fields object should be &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; key of an array of object
like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;id,site_name,site_url and status&lt;/code&gt;.You can the code below:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;download&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;excel &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;fields&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;fields&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mb-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Export To Excel&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Aguidehub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://aguidehub.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://infinitbility.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Inactive&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table striped hover &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Register &lt;strong&gt;JsonExcel&lt;/strong&gt; to vue entry point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to register the &lt;strong&gt;JsonExcel&lt;/strong&gt; package to vue entry point. Then we can use the package in our component template. To register the package you can use this code in your main.js file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; JsonExcel &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue-json-excel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;downloadExcel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; JsonExcel&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;download-excel&lt;/strong&gt; to your template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;strong&gt;download-excel&lt;/strong&gt; code to your template And pass the props &lt;strong&gt;:data=“items”&lt;/strong&gt; data and value of the props should be your table data array of objects. In this example, we are passing the props value &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt;. And we are added the &lt;strong&gt;b-button&lt;/strong&gt;, you can follow the code below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;download&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;excel &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mb-5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Export To Excel&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;download&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;excel&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;let’s check the examples of how to create a responsive table in BootstrapVue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Passing &lt;strong&gt;responsive&lt;/strong&gt; as the props in &lt;strong&gt;b-table-simple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to create the responsive table in bootstrap-vue. Using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;responsive&lt;/code&gt; prop allows tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease. Make any table responsive across all viewports by setting the prop responsive to true. Let’s see the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Passing &lt;strong&gt;responsive&lt;/strong&gt; as the props in &lt;strong&gt;b-table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to create the responsive table in bootstrap-vue. Using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;responsive&lt;/code&gt; prop allows tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease. Make any table responsive across all viewports by setting the prop responsive to true. Let’s see the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table responsive &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Passing &lt;strong&gt;sticky-header&lt;/strong&gt; as the props in &lt;strong&gt;b-table-simple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to create the sticky header in the bootstrap-vue table. Using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sticky-header&lt;/code&gt; prop to enable a vertically scrolling table with headers that remain fixed (sticky) as the table body scrolls. Let’s see the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;simple sticky&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;header&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;thead&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tr&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;No&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Website Name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Website &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Website Status&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tr&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Passing &lt;strong&gt;sticky-header&lt;/strong&gt; as the props in b-table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to create the sticky header in the bootstrap-vue table. Using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sticky-header&lt;/code&gt; prop to enable a vertically scrolling table with headers that remain fixed (sticky) as the table body scrolls. Let’s see the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table sticky&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;header striped hover &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create simple table using &lt;strong&gt;b-table-simple&lt;/strong&gt; component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to create the simple table using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table-simple&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. This &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table-simple&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component gives complete control over how we want to render the table. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table-simple&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a wrapper component around the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. Inside the component, via the default slot, you can use any or all of the BootstrapVue table helper components &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-thead&gt;, &amp;lt;b-tfoot&gt;, &amp;lt;b-tbody&gt;, &amp;lt;b-tr&gt;, &amp;lt;b-th&gt;, &amp;lt;b-td&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;simple&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;thead&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;tr&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;No&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Website Name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Website Status&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Aguidehub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://aguidehub.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://infinitbility.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Inactive&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Option 1 : Using the bootstrap class&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other ways to hide the table header. we are going to use the bootstrap class to hide the table header row, table header which is gotten by default from the array of &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt;.you can see that the vue bootstrap class is &lt;strong&gt;thead-class=“d-none”&lt;/strong&gt; , it will not display the table header which is displaying the previously by default in b-table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table striped hover &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt; thead&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;d-none&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Inactive&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output first option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Output&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/sortoutcode-images/thead-class%20vue-bootstrap.gif&quot; alt=&quot;bootstrap vue table hide header&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Option 2 : Using the &lt;strong&gt;thStyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t look like there is anything in docs to hide the row completely, So we can create our method. We are going to create &lt;strong&gt;fields array of object&lt;/strong&gt; and set &lt;strong&gt;thStyle&lt;/strong&gt; object value as &lt;strong&gt;display:none&lt;/strong&gt; to hide the table heading from the header. let’s see the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the table column width from the data array of objects using BootstrapVue in VueJS.We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the table and for the change table columns width we are using the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array of objects, in the table we are passing the &lt;strong&gt;:filter&lt;/strong&gt; props on table columns in BootstrapVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you add a filter on the table in bootstrap-vue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pass the &lt;strong&gt;:filter&lt;/strong&gt; props in the table&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add filter functionality in the BootstrapVue table?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Aguidehub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://aguidehub.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://infinitbility.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Inactive&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of objects for table columns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;, Fields data can be a simple array, for defining the order of the columns, and which columns to display. We are going to use the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array data as the table heading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;No.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;site_name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Website Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;site_url&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pass the &lt;strong&gt;:filter&lt;/strong&gt; props in table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to add &lt;strong&gt;b-input&lt;/strong&gt; field with &lt;strong&gt;v-filter&lt;/strong&gt; modal and pass the &lt;strong&gt;:filter&lt;/strong&gt; props to &lt;strong&gt;b-table&lt;/strong&gt; value of filter props is the input table value which means the value of the input field is passed as filter data in a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can pass the table fields data as the array of objects, it will provide you with extra control over the fields. Only &lt;strong&gt;columns (keys)&lt;/strong&gt; that appear in the fields array will be shown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the final codes for &lt;strong&gt;b-table&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove &lt;strong&gt;(Click to sort Ascending)&lt;/strong&gt; text from the header of every column BootstrapVue.We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the table and for adding the sorting on the table, in the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; data we are using the &lt;strong&gt;sortable: true&lt;/strong&gt; boolean value to enable the sorting for a column in BootstrapVue.And for removing the &lt;strong&gt;(Click to sort Ascending)&lt;/strong&gt; text from the header we are going to Set the &lt;strong&gt;label-sort-asc&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;label-sort-desc&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;label-sort-clear&lt;/strong&gt; props to an empty string to remove the sorting labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you remove the (Click to sort Ascending) text from header sorting from a table in BootstrapVue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of objects for table columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the &lt;strong&gt;sortable: true&lt;/strong&gt; boolean value in &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;strong&gt;label-sort-asc&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;label-sort-desc&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;label-sort-clear&lt;/strong&gt; props to an empty string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I remove the (Click to sort descending) text from the header from the table in BootstrapVue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Aguidehub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://aguidehub.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://infinitbility.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Inactive&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of objects for table columns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;, Fields data can be a simple array, for defining the order of the columns, and which columns to display. We are going to use the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array data as the table heading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;No.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sortable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;site_name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Website Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sortable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;sort&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;asc&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;sort&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;desc&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;sort&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;clear&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can pass the table fields data as the array of objects, it will provide you with extra control over the fields. Only &lt;strong&gt;columns (keys)&lt;/strong&gt; that appear in the fields array will be shown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the final codes for &lt;strong&gt;b-table&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table striped hover &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;fields&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;fields&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
    label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;sort&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;asc&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add sorting on the table using BootstrapVue in VueJS.We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the table and for adding the sorting on the table, we are using the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array of objects, in the fields data we are using the &lt;strong&gt;sortable: true&lt;/strong&gt; boolean value to enable the sorting for a column in BootstrapVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you add sorting in the table in BootstrapVue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of objects for table columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the &lt;strong&gt;sortable: true&lt;/strong&gt; boolean value in &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add sorting in the table in BootstrapVue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Aguidehub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://aguidehub.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://infinitbility.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Inactive&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of objects for table columns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;, Fields data can be a simple array, for defining the order of the columns, and which columns to display. We are going to use the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array data as the table heading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;No.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sortable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;site_name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Website Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sortable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add the &lt;strong&gt;sortable: true&lt;/strong&gt; boolean value in &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the sorting the feature in bootstrap table, we have to add &lt;strong&gt;sortable: true&lt;/strong&gt; boolean value in &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can pass the table fields data as the array of objects, it will provide you with extra control over the fields. Only &lt;strong&gt;columns (keys)&lt;/strong&gt; that appear in the fields array will be shown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the final codes for &lt;strong&gt;b-table&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table striped hover &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;fields&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;fields&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Aguidehub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://aguidehub.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://infinitbility.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Inactive&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of objects for table columns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;, Fields data can be a simple array, for defining the order of the columns, and which columns to display. We are going to use the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array data as the table heading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;No.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;site_name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Define the &lt;strong&gt;thStyle&lt;/strong&gt; object in &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thStyle&lt;/strong&gt; object represent the CSS styles.if you define the CSS,the declared the style will applied on the table &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;thead&gt;/&amp;lt;tfoot&gt;&lt;/code&gt; field &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
we are going to use the &lt;strong&gt;width&lt;/strong&gt; CSS property:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can pass the table fields data as the array of objects, it will provide you with extra control over the fields. Only &lt;strong&gt;columns (keys)&lt;/strong&gt; that appear in the fields array will be shown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the final codes for &lt;strong&gt;b-table&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the table heading from an array of objects using BootstrapVue in VueJS.We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the table and for the table heading we are using the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array of objects, in the fields data we are using the &lt;strong&gt;label&lt;/strong&gt; property to change the table heading in BootstrapVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you set different table heading other than the array of objects in vueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of objects for table columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I set custom table heading from fields array of objects using the BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of objects for table columns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;, Fields data can be a simple array, for defining the order of the columns, and which columns to display. We are going to use the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array data as the table heading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can pass the table fields data as the array of objects, it will provide you with extra control over the fields. Only &lt;strong&gt;columns (keys)&lt;/strong&gt; that appear in the fields array will be shown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the final codes for &lt;strong&gt;b-table&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table striped hover &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;fields&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;fields&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system.

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of objects for table columns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;, Fields data can be a simple array, for defining the order of the columns, and which columns to display. We are going to use the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array data as the table heading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can pass the table fields data as the array of objects, it will provide you with extra control over the fields. Only &lt;strong&gt;columns (keys)&lt;/strong&gt; that appear in the fields array will be shown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the final codes for &lt;strong&gt;b-table&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table striped hover &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;fields&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;fields&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a table heading using BootstrapVue in VueJS.We are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create the table and for the table heading we are using the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array in BootstrapVue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you define the table heading in bootstrap-vue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of properties for table heading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;*How do I create custom **th&lt;/strong&gt; labels for b-table using the BootstrapVue in VueJS?***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system.

&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; Array of properties for table heading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;, Fields data can be a simple array, for defining the order of the columns, and which columns to display. We are going to use the &lt;strong&gt;fields&lt;/strong&gt; array data as the table heading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;site_url&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;site_name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Aguidehub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://aguidehub.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://infinitbility.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the final codes for &lt;strong&gt;b-table&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I create a table using the BootstrapVue in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation. In that article, I had also show you how to install BootstrapVue in your vue.js project step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays of objects property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Aguidehub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://aguidehub.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://infinitbility.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create FirstComponent.vue and import it into App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new component into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; components folder.the component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and import into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;App&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
#app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;family&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Avenir&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Helvetica&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Arial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; sans&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;serif&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;align&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #2c3e50&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  margin&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 60px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b-table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag create table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;b-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically samples the first row of the key of the array into the table heading. and All the first row of the array of keys
Field names are automatically &lt;strong&gt;humanized&lt;/strong&gt; by converting &lt;strong&gt;kebab-case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snake_case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;camelCase&lt;/strong&gt; to individual words and capitalizing each word. you can see some of the examples listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first_name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-name&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; remains &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;isActive&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Is Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the final codes for &lt;strong&gt;b-table&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table striped hover &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;table&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install the &lt;strong&gt;vue-bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt; in the VueJS project, we are using the command and installing the vue.js project after that we are installing the &lt;strong&gt;vue-bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Vue globally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Vue project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the Vue project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register the BootstrapVue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I install or configure vue-bootstrap in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Install the node&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For installing the node.js, go to node.js official website and download the current version of node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node.js is, allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the node.js application from the official website &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot;&gt;Node. js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the download is complete, install the node application in your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Install Vue.js globally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this command you can install the Vue.js framework globally in your system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;npm install &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;g @vue&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install vue using ‘npm’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am installing the project using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install -g @vue/cli&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can verify that it is properly installed by simply running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue&lt;/code&gt;, which should present you with a help message listing all available commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can run this &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue --version&lt;/code&gt; command to know your &lt;strong&gt;vue/cli&lt;/strong&gt;  version. &lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3. Create Vue js project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new project run this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;vue create sortoutcode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sortoutcode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is our project name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will give you the option to select, which version you want to install &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vue 2 or Vue 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or perhaps choose the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manually select feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; option, in this article I’m using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vue 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Run the Vue project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the Command prompt Go to your project directory and run this command &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm run serve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running this command &lt;strong&gt;npm run serve&lt;/strong&gt; server is started. Now go to Browser, and run the localhost &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to open your project running.&lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 5: Install the Bootstrap and BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to install Bootstrap v4 and BootstrapVue in our VueJS project. For that, we can use the &lt;strong&gt;npm&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;yarn&lt;/strong&gt; to install the Bootstrap v4 and BootstrapVue.In this tutorial, we are using the &lt;strong&gt;npm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// With npm use this command&lt;/span&gt;
npm install vue bootstrap bootstrap&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;vue


&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// With yarn use this command&lt;/span&gt;
yarn add vue bootstrap bootstrap&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation is complete.we need to initialize or register the BootstrapVue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step:6 Register the BootstrapVue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation is completed we are going to initialize or register the BootstrapVue in your app entry point which would be the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt;. For initialization, we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt; entry point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; App &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./App.vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; BootstrapVue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; IconsPlugin &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap-vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bootstrap-vue/dist/bootstrap-vue.css&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;BootstrapVue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;IconsPlugin&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;config&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;productionTip &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;App&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To, Check if BootstrapVue is installed or not perfectly. we are printing some text in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;webkit&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; antialiased&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;moz&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;osx&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;font&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;smoothing&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; grayscale&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the above code, I Removed the unwanted text, link, heading, and image from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;. Press Ctrl + U to view the web page source.
You can see that the CSS style &lt;strong&gt;BootstrapVue Custom CSS (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bootstrap-vue.org&quot;&gt;https://bootstrap-vue.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Remove hash(#) from URL from vue 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I remove the hash(#) from the URL in the vue-router package in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the vue-router&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation, of the vue project, Configure the &lt;strong&gt;vue-router&lt;/strong&gt; module in your project. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation. It will also guide you, on how to show the router views using the &lt;strong&gt;router-view&lt;/strong&gt; and how to use &lt;strong&gt;router-link&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-configure-or-install-vue-router-module-in-vuejs/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to configure or Install vue-router module in VueJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remove hash(#) from URL from vue 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, The hash is in the URL &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/#/&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/#/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the page. The hash is shown in every page link,&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove the &lt;strong&gt;Hash(#)&lt;/strong&gt; from the URL, In vue 2 we have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mode: &apos;history&apos;&lt;/code&gt; in the router as you can see in the example of VueJS 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Router &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue-router&apos;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; ComponentName &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;../components/ComponentName.vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Router&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; router &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;path&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ComponentName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Your Component Name&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;history&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; router&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remove hash(#) from URL from vue 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have created the two components that are &lt;strong&gt;FirstComponent.vue &amp;#x26; SecondComponent.vue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    This is First Component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SecondComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    This is Second Component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;SecondComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vue 3 we have import the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;createWebHistory&lt;/code&gt; then use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;history: createWebHistory()&lt;/code&gt; code in your vue router module as you can see in the example of VueJS 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; createWebHistory&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; createRouter &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue-router&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;@/components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; SecondComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;@/components/SecondComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; routes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/second&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Second&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; SecondComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; router &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createWebHistory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  routes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; router&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output for Vue 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you configure or Install the vue-router module in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the two components &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configure the vue-router&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the view in App.js &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I configure or Install the vue-router module in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation.
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the two components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For creating the components go to the project directory and then follow the path &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/components/&lt;/code&gt; inside the components directory create components with &lt;strong&gt;.vue&lt;/strong&gt; extension for example &lt;strong&gt;FirstComponent.vue &amp;#x26; SecondComponent.vue&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the path of files, you can follow this snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created First Components name was &lt;strong&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    This is First Component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other Created component name was &lt;strong&gt;SecondComponent.vue&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SecondComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    This is Second Component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;configure the vue-router&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the main.js file first, we need to import a vue-router module from a node_modules folder because we have installed all of our dependencies in this project. Copy the following code into our main.js file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/main.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; createApp &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; router &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./router&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// &amp;lt;---&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;App&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;router&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;#app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file inside the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src/router/index.js&lt;/code&gt; and create routes and import your components &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; createWebHashHistory&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; createRouter &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue-router&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;@/components/FirstComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; SecondComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;@/components/SecondComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; routes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;First&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; FirstComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/second&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Second&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; SecondComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; router &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createWebHashHistory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  routes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; router&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that we create our routes in an array, where we specify for each route a few important items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path - the URL path where this route can be found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name - An optional name to use when we link to this route.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Component - Which component to load when this route is called.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice we export this at the bottom because we’ll need to import it in our main.js file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show the view in App.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convert string to HTML in vueJS, we are using the &lt;strong&gt;v-html&lt;/strong&gt; to convert string to HTML, we are passing the string with some string HTML tag And returning the output with HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you convert string to HTML in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define computed property &lt;strong&gt;libText&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I convert string to HTML in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the three properties that are &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define computed property &lt;strong&gt;libText&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vueJS, computed properties enable you to create the property that can be used to modify, manipulate or display data in components in a readable and efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we are using for to concatenate the html tag and string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can see the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;libText&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;libText&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;    
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;computed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;           
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;libText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// return directly html&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; str&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;msg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;/p&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; str&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are using the &lt;strong&gt;v-html&lt;/strong&gt; to show the string as you see them in the code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare the string in VueJS, we are using The directive &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-if&lt;/code&gt; used to conditionally render a block. The block will only be rendered if the directive’s expression returns a truth value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you compare two strings in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;sitename,siteurl&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the v-if directive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I compare two string in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;sitename,siteurl&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;sitename,siteurl&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sitename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;siteurl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the three properties that are &lt;strong&gt;sitename,siteurl&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the v-if directive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are using the &lt;strong&gt;v-if&lt;/strong&gt; directive to conditionally render the block. The block will only render if the directive’s expression returns a true value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;span v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sitename == &apos;SortoutCode&apos;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;siteurl == &apos;https://sortoutcode.com/&apos;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;https&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;span v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sitename == &apos;website&apos;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sitename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;siteurl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the output’s first two blocks are rendered because its expression value returns the true value.
And the last expression value returns the false that’s why it does not render the last one block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create or set up the hello world example in vueJS, we are using the VueJS &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Component&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with props message, Using the Component props we are showing the “Hello World” string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you create a hello world example in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install vue-cli globally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create vue Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pass the &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; as props&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the Props in Component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I create a hello world example in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install vue-cli globally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, you need to install the &lt;strong&gt;NodeJS&lt;/strong&gt; In your system. You can download and install the application from the &lt;strong&gt;NodeJS&lt;/strong&gt; official website. After that need to install the &lt;strong&gt;vue-cli&lt;/strong&gt; globally in our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that we are using this command &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install -g @vue/cli&lt;/code&gt;, It will take some time to install all the packages in our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installation, you will have access to the &lt;strong&gt;vue&lt;/strong&gt; binary in your command line. You can verify that it is properly installed by simply running &lt;strong&gt;vue&lt;/strong&gt;, which should present you with a help message listing all available commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify that it is properly installed or not. we are using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue --version&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create vue Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the vue hello world project, we are using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue create hello-world&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be asked you for which version &lt;strong&gt;Vue 3&lt;/strong&gt; OR &lt;strong&gt;Vue 2&lt;/strong&gt; to install &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render the block conditionally, we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-if&lt;/code&gt; directive. It renders the block if the directive’s expression returns the truth value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you use conditional rendering in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;sitename,searchText&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the v-if directive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the v-else-if directive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I use conditional rendering in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;sitename,searchText&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;sitename&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sitename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sortoutcode.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;searchText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the three properties that are &lt;strong&gt;sitename,searchText&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the v-if And v-else directive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are using the &lt;strong&gt;v-if&lt;/strong&gt; directive to conditionally render the block. The block will only render if the directive’s expression returns a true value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;strong&gt;v-if&lt;/strong&gt; directive expression returns the false value &lt;strong&gt;v-else&lt;/strong&gt; block will render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button @click&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sitename = !sitename&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Toggle&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1 v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sitename&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hi Friends Welcome To SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1 v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to Infinitbility&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sitename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sortoutcode.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output of the &lt;strong&gt;v-if And v-else&lt;/strong&gt; directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Output&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/sortoutcode-images/v-if-conditional-randering.gif&quot; alt=&quot;v-if And v-else directive&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the v-else-if directive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-else-if&lt;/code&gt; as the name suggests the &lt;strong&gt;else-if&lt;/strong&gt; block.It renders on multiple conditions, it works just like the normal &lt;strong&gt;ifelse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input type&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;searchText&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button @click&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sitename = searchText&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Toggle&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show data in the table dynamically in vueJS, we are using the &lt;strong&gt;v-for&lt;/strong&gt; directive to show data in the table dynamically, And render a list of items based on an array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you show data in a table dynamically in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;tableData&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using vueJS &lt;strong&gt;v-for&lt;/strong&gt; directive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I show data in a table dynamically in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;tableData&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;tableData&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;tableData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sitename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://infinitbility.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sitename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortOutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://sortoutcode.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sitename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Aguidehub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://aguidehub.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;sitename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;site_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://test.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;tableData&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using vueJS &lt;strong&gt;v-for&lt;/strong&gt; loop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-for&lt;/code&gt; directive to render a list of items based on an array. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-for&lt;/code&gt; directive requires a special syntax in the form of &lt;strong&gt;data in tableData&lt;/strong&gt;, where &lt;strong&gt;tableData&lt;/strong&gt; is the source data array and &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt; is an alias for the array element being iterated on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;table &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;table&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;thead &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;thead-dark&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;tr&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;th scope&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;col&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;th scope&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;col&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Site Name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;th scope&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;col&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Site &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;th scope&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;col&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Status&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;th&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;tr&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;thead&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;tbody&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;tr v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;data in tableData&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;data.id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To split the string in vueJS, we are using the &lt;strong&gt;split()&lt;/strong&gt; method splits a string into an array of substrings, and returns the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you split the string in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;string.split()&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;String()&lt;/strong&gt; Convert Array to string show Output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I split the string in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;result&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To SortoutCode!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;msg, result&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using string.split() method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; method splits the string and converts it into an array of substrings, and returns the array of substrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example, the long string &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt;, we are going to splits method we are going to split &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; string into substring of array and store in &lt;strong&gt;substring&lt;/strong&gt; variable. And print the Output :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Split Method &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;Output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;substring&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To SortoutCode!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;substring &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;   
        
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s check the output of the full code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To replace the String in vueJS, we are using the &lt;strong&gt;replace()&lt;/strong&gt; method to replace the string with another string that is passed in the parameter And return the output with replaced string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you replace the String in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;msg,result&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;string.replace()&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I replace the String in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;result&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To aguidehub.com!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;msg, result&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;string.replace()&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;replace()&lt;/code&gt; method searches the string for value and returns the new string with replaced string. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;replace()&lt;/code&gt; method does not change the origin string, it returns the new string with replaced value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Before &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;Replace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;After Replace Print &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;Output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To aguidehub.com!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get String length in vueJS, we are using the VueJS &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.length&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; attribute &lt;strong&gt;string.length&lt;/strong&gt; ,it will return the length of string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you get String length in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;string.length&lt;/strong&gt; attribute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I get String length in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;result&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;string.length&lt;/strong&gt; attribute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can easily find out the string length. Using the vueJS &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.length&lt;/code&gt; attribute. we can get vue js to get string length using the &lt;strong&gt;.length&lt;/strong&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems very easy, but sometimes we need to get our string length or size at the time we need to get length using Vue js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Message&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Message Length&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do sting interpolation in vueJS, we are using the VueJS &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;${..}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, it will return the result of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you do sting interpolation in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I sting interpolation in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;msg,message,number,isActive,result&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;msg&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;result&lt;/strong&gt; in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;isActive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;msg,message,number,isActive,result&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example of String interpolation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The string interpolation in JavaScript is performed by template literals (strings wrapped in backticks) and ${expression} as a placeholder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let’s see the code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you add a new line in string in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;str1,str2,msg1,msg2&lt;/strong&gt; for test &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;pre&lt;/strong&gt; tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;br&lt;/strong&gt; tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;textarea&lt;/strong&gt; tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;white-space:pre;&lt;/strong&gt; style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I add a new line in string in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;str1,str2,msg1,msg2&lt;/strong&gt; for test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the number in data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;str1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;str2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Welcome To SortoutCode!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hi Friends \n Welcome To SortoutCode!&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been described in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;str1,str2,msg1,msg2&lt;/strong&gt; properties you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;pre&lt;/strong&gt; tag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use the newline character, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;, which is used in javascript and many other languages. For adding the new in your string or character we have to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; before that string or character. It will break the line and add a new line to a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; msg2 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hi Friends \n Welcome To SortoutCode!&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;br&lt;/strong&gt; tag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the old method for the new line using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag will insert a single line break. we can use the two different strings and using the &lt;strong&gt;br&lt;/strong&gt; tag add the new line in the string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let’s see the example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;str1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;br&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;str2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;textarea&lt;/strong&gt; tag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; character in between the string. To print that string we are using the &lt;strong&gt;Textarea&lt;/strong&gt; input tag. In the textarea long string break and add a new line in the string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;textarea v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;model&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;msg2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;textarea&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hi Friends \nWelcome To SortoutCode!&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;white-space:pre;&lt;/strong&gt; style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML ignores newlines unless you specify &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;white-space:pre&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;white-space: pre-line in CSS. Therefore,n we use the&lt;/code&gt;\n` character in the string and use it with another HTML tag it, will not work let’s see the example, of how they worked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h2 style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;white-space:pre&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;msg2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h4 style&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;white-space:pre-line&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;msg2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h4&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Concatenate the string and variable in vueJS, just use the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ES5 &lt;strong&gt;+ oprator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ES6 &lt;strong&gt;Template strings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;concat()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these three solutions you can Concatenate your string and variable, it will return the join string. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you concate strings and variables in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;names&lt;/strong&gt; property for Test &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using ES5 &lt;strong&gt;+ oprator&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using ES6 &lt;strong&gt;Template strings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;concat()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I concate string and variable in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;names&lt;/strong&gt; array for Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the number in data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sortoutcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;names&lt;/strong&gt; variable you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using ES5 &lt;strong&gt;+ oprator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;strong&gt;+ operator&lt;/strong&gt; to concatenate string and variable. Let’s see examples of how we can concatenate using the &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;  operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sortoutcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;names &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// sortoutcode.com&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using ES6 &lt;strong&gt;Template strings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to use the ES6 &lt;strong&gt;Template strings&lt;/strong&gt; for that we have to understand some concept of ‘Template’. Let’s start with the &lt;strong&gt;Template Literals&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ES6 &lt;strong&gt;Template Literals&lt;/strong&gt; use back-ticks (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) rather than quotes (&quot;&quot;) to define a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let’s see the example of &lt;strong&gt;Template Literals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Template Literals&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; text &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method is called string interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;${...}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;strong&gt;Template strings&lt;/strong&gt; to concatenate string and variable. Let’s see examples of how we can concatenate using the &lt;strong&gt;Template strings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Template strings&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;infinitbility&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;names&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// infinitbility.com&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;concat()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;concat()&lt;/strong&gt; method concatenates the string arguments to the calling string and returns a new string. Changes to the original string or the returned string don’t affect the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we can pass the One or more strings to concatenate our first string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the syntax examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; str1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;str1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; str2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the complete code example &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;concat()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//expected output: aguidehub.com&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you check the array contains a value in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;names&lt;/strong&gt; array for test &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the Output of &lt;strong&gt;Array.includes()&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Array contain value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I check the array contains a value in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;names&lt;/strong&gt; array for test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the number in data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Welcome&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;to&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sortcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sortoutcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the &lt;strong&gt;names array&lt;/strong&gt; you can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the Output of &lt;strong&gt;Array.includes()&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;includes()&lt;/code&gt; method return the &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; if the value exists else return the &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Welcome&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;to&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sortcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sortoutcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sortcode includes, &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;names&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Sortcode&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;game includes, &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;names&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;game&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you check if an index exists in an array or not in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the defining the array,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Welcome&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;to&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sortcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sortoutcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the names array with some data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we console the names array index 3 and 4 it returns the &lt;strong&gt;Sortoutcode&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;undefined&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;names&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Sortoutcode&lt;/span&gt;
console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;names&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we put this index access value syntax in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;if...else&lt;/code&gt; and check whether we can know index exists or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you convert string to array in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are going to see how we can convert the string to the array using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; method in vuejs. I will give you a simple example of converting a string to an array by comma, dot, semicolon, space, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are working with a javascript method called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; and how this worked. The split() method is used to split the string into an array of the substring and returns a new collection array. you can see bellow following syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;myArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;separator&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define three-string &lt;strong&gt;string1,string2,string3&lt;/strong&gt; for test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an array using a comma, separator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an array using a space separator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create array element without any separator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I convert string to array in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define three string &lt;strong&gt;string1,string2,string3&lt;/strong&gt; for test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;string1,string2,string3&lt;/strong&gt; in data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;string1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;78,185,289,389,43&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;string2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;034 14 26 37 489&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;string3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;123401&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the three properties that are &lt;strong&gt;string1,string2, and string3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create an array using a comma, separator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a comma-separated string and you want to make an array, you will do it like the below example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;string1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;78,185,289,389,43&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; arr1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;string1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;,&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arr1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// [&apos;78&apos;, &apos;185&apos;, &apos;289&apos;, &apos;389&apos;, &apos;43&apos;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output of the &lt;strong&gt;split()&lt;/strong&gt; method with &lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; separator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create an array using a space separator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a space-separated string and you want to make an array, you will do it like the below example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;string2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;034 14 26 37 489&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; arr1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;string2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arr1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// [&apos;034&apos;, &apos;14&apos;, &apos;26&apos;, &apos;37&apos;, &apos;489&apos;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output of &lt;strong&gt;split()&lt;/strong&gt; method with &lt;strong&gt;space&lt;/strong&gt; separator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Output&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create array element without any separator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make an array element for every string element, you will do it like the below example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;string3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;123401&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; arr1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;string3&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;arr1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// [&apos;1&apos;, &apos;2&apos;, &apos;3&apos;, &apos;4&apos;, &apos;0&apos;, &apos;1&apos;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output of the &lt;strong&gt;split()&lt;/strong&gt; method with every string element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Output&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you create an array of objects in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will help you to create an array of objects means multiple objects available in an array in javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript provides a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;push()&lt;/code&gt; method to add an element to the array and today we are going to use it to add a new object to the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I create an array of objects in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to create an empty array, and then we have to push the new object into an array check the below example with Output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; newArray &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;newArray &gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; newArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// adding new object in array&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output of &lt;strong&gt;Array.push()&lt;/strong&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you check value is decimal or not in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will help you to check value is decimal or not in javascript, here we will you three ways to check decimal numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define three string &lt;strong&gt;num1,num2,num3,num4&lt;/strong&gt; for test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number.isInteger() Method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math.floor() Method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using indexOf() Method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I check value is decimal or not in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Define three string &lt;strong&gt;num1,num2,num3,num4&lt;/strong&gt; for test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the &lt;strong&gt;num1,num2,num3,num4&lt;/strong&gt; in data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;786.00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;786&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;786.03&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;25.00000000000001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the three properties that are &lt;strong&gt;num1,num2,num3,num4&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Number.isInteger() Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are using the &lt;strong&gt;Number.isInteger()&lt;/strong&gt; Method for chack whether value decimal or not. &lt;strong&gt;Number.isInteger()&lt;/strong&gt; is part of the ES6 standard, and if you are using an older version, you should move to the second solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;786.00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;786&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;786.03&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;25.00000000000001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;is decimal,&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;Number&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;isInteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// false&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;is decimal,&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;Number&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;isInteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// false&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num3&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;is decimal,&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;Number&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;isInteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num3&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output of &lt;strong&gt;Number.isInteger()&lt;/strong&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Output&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Math.floor() Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check decimal numbers, we will use Javascript Math.floor() Method, which will same work as Number.isInteger() method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Using indexOf() Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get isDecimal to provide true when you pass 0.00, and 12.00 then you will help &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;indexOf()&lt;/code&gt; Method, it only checks ”.” in provided value, and if it is available it will return true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: to use indexOf() method you have to first convert the value number to a string.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output of &lt;strong&gt;str.indexOf()&lt;/strong&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you check value is a number or not in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javascript provides multiple ways to check value is a number or not isNaN(),Number.isFinite(), and typeof() methods are some of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt; for test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using isNaN() Method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Number.isFinite() Method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using typeof() Method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I check value is a number or not in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Define &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt; with number value for test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the ‘value’ in data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;786&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the one property that is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Using isNaN Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;isNaN()&lt;/code&gt; determines whether a value is NaN or not. We can take advantage of this to determine whether a variable is number type or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;786&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// number&lt;/span&gt;

        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Number&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;isFinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// returns false&lt;/span&gt;
        
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Number&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;isFinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// returns false&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output with the &lt;strong&gt;other datatype value of Number.isFinite()&lt;/strong&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Using typeof()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javascript provides the type of operator to check the type of data, when we pass any number, float then type of return number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you check values exist in an array of objects in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the common task for a frontend developer to check whether the value exists in an array of objects or not. There can be many other ways but in this tutorial, we are going to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;findIndex()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All below tutorials work on javascript, React, React Native, Vue, Node, Deno, typescript, and all javascript frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;users&lt;/strong&gt; array of object for test &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Array.findIndex()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Array.find()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Array.includes()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I check values exist in an array of objects in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;users&lt;/strong&gt; array of the object for a test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the number in data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sort&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;shortout&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sortoutcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the users array of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Array.findIndex() method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javascript provides the&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;findIndex()&lt;/code&gt; method to find value in the array, and we can also use this method to check whether a value exists or not in an array of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s understand the output through the Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SortoutCode&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sort&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;javascript &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;findIndex()&lt;/code&gt; method return index of object if value match else it will return -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output of &lt;strong&gt;findIndex()&lt;/strong&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output of &lt;strong&gt;find()&lt;/strong&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you convert numbers to strings in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;String()&lt;/code&gt; method creates a primitive String type for a number that is passed in it as a parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All below tutorials work on javascript, React, React Native, Vue, Node, Deno, typescript, and all javascript frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define number for test from &lt;strong&gt;String()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I convert number to string in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define number for test from &lt;strong&gt;String()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the number in data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the two empty properties that are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;num&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, we create first on num property in data and store number on it and check their datatype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a number to string conversion, we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;String(this.num);&lt;/code&gt; method and re-console string value and their datatype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;786&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;result &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you convert string to number in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Number()&lt;/code&gt; method converts the passed value into a number. If it is not the number then it returns &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All below tutorials work on javascript, React, React Native, Vue, Node, Deno, typescript, and all javascript frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define string number for test from &lt;strong&gt;Number()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I convert string to number in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define string number for test from &lt;strong&gt;Number()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the number in data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we define the two empty properties that are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;num&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, we create first on num property in data and store string in it and check their datatype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For string to number conversion, we are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Number(this.num);&lt;/code&gt; method and re-console the Number value and their datatype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sortoutcode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;786&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;result &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;num&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you replace the first matching of a string in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will help you to replace the same strings or words from your string data. we will see two methods to replace all occurrences in a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are going to replace using the below methods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define Content for test from &lt;strong&gt;replace()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript &lt;strong&gt;replace()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript replace with regex global method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I replace the first matching of a string in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define Content for test from replace() method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the Content in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;longstring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends an an Welcome To SortoutCode!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above code &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;long string&lt;/code&gt; is the property that returns the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends an an Welcome To SortoutCode!&quot;&lt;/code&gt; content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Javascript replaceAll() method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replace() method returns a new string with all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it also does not work in older node.js versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;{{longstring}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;All the word &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;an&apos;&lt;/span&gt; is replaced &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;very&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you replace all occurrences of a string in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will help you to replace the same strings or words from your string data. we will see two methods to replace all occurrences in a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are going to replace using the below methods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define Content for test from &lt;strong&gt;replaceAll()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript &lt;strong&gt;replaceAll()&lt;/strong&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript replace with regex global method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I replace all occurrences of a string in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define Content for test from replaceAll() method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the Content in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;longstring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends an an Welcome To SortoutCode!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In above code &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;long string&lt;/code&gt; is the property that returns the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends an an Welcome To SortoutCode!&quot;&lt;/code&gt; content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Javascript replaceAll() method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replaceAll() method returns a new string with all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it also does not work in older node.js versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;{{longstring}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;All the word &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;an&apos;&lt;/span&gt; is replaced &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;very&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you use Regular expressions ( regex ) in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will help you to use Regular expressions ( regex ) in VueJS, here we will learn below three points in VueJS regex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define Content for the test from regex &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regex to get true or false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regex to get match value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regex to get no of occurrence match value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I use Regular expressions ( regex ) in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define Content for the test from regex&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the Content in the data of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To SortoutCode!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above code &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; is the property that returns the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To SortoutCode!&quot;&lt;/code&gt; content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regex to get true or false&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.test()&lt;/code&gt; method, it will return true when the string matches or false if not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;{{items}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;regex matches &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SortoutCode&quot;&lt;/span&gt; strings from content&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi Friends Welcome To SortoutCode!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; regex &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token regex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token regex-delimiter&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token regex-source language-regex&quot;&gt;SortoutCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token regex-delimiter&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; matches &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; regex&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;items&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;result &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; matches&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;How do you search for an array of the object.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There are two methods to search in an array of the object&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Method 1: The first method is using a custom function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if there particular string or value exists then we are going to loop over the array of objects and find out whether the string of value exists or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are going to create a function with two-parameter, First one is a string and the second one is an array of object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First Create an array of object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a function with two-parameter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop over the array of objects and return that property&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I search an array of objects in javascript?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First Create an array of object&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s create an array of objects with some random data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; myArray &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;welcome&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;to&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sortoutcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test 1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test 1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test 1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;new string&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;new string&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;new string&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create a function with two-parameter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to create a function with two parameters, the First one is that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;string&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which we are searching in an array of objects, and the second parameter is an array of object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;nameKey&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; myArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; myArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;myArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;other &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; nameKey&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;myArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; myArray &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;welcome&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;to&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sortoutcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test 1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test 1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Test 1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;new string&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;new string&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; resultObject &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sortoutcode&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; myArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the &lt;strong&gt;first method&lt;/strong&gt; output.

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Method 2: The second method is using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;filter()&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second method, we are going to use ES6 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; function in JavaScript to filter the object array based on attributes. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; function will return a new array containing all the array elements that pass the given condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no elements pass the condition it returns an empty array. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; function loops or iterate over each array element and pass each element to the callback function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also I am using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;includes()&lt;/code&gt; method which returns &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; if an array contains a specified value, if not it returns the &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt; value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we are going to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First we are going to create an &lt;strong&gt;array&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the variable, which we are going to &lt;strong&gt;find&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside the &lt;strong&gt;filter()&lt;/strong&gt; method Find the object Array property value &lt;strong&gt;includes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Console the result &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the below code I used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;include()&lt;/code&gt; functions to create a new array of object
that contains the matched string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; apiArray &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;aguideHub&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Infinitbility&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;SortoutCode&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; toSearch &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;SortoutCode&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//Will check if title have text &apos;search&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; result &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; apiArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; o&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;info&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;toSearch&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; Finalrerult &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FiltedResult: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;Finalrerult&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, as per expectaion it should show you array of object &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FiltedResult: [{&quot;info&quot;:{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;SortoutCode&quot;}}]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you define and render an array of data in VueJS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define array in data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Render the Array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will guide you to &lt;strong&gt;how do I define an array and how to render the array in vueJS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Define array in data function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I am going to create a component with the name &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; and register it.
Data is the private memory of each component where you can store any variables you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, what is data function in Vue? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is used to define properties in a particular component. In a single-file component, data is a function that returns a set of properties that have been defined in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to add a &lt;strong&gt;items&lt;/strong&gt; array property to our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/code&gt; component, I can do it using data as shown in the script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FirstComponent.vue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hi Friends&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Welcome To SortoutCode!&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Render the array&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can render a list of items based on our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;items&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; array using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-for&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v-for&lt;/code&gt; directive requires a special syntax in the form of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;item in items&lt;/code&gt;, where items are the source data array and item is an alias for the array element being iterated on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;item in items&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;item.id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;message&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;FirstComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hi Friends&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Welcome To SortoutCode!&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;how do you install VueJS globally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with a project example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue is a javascript framework that is built for user interfaces. It is a component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the vueJS framework installation, there are some pre-requirement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Node.js&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Vue globally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Vue project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the Vue project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will guide you to &lt;strong&gt;How do I install the Vue framework&lt;/strong&gt; with an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Install the node&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For installing the node.js, go to node.js official website and download the current version of nodejs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node.js is, allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the nodejs application from the official website &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot;&gt;Node. js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the download is complete, install the node application in your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Install Vue.js globally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this command you can install the Vue.js framework globally in your system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;npm install &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;g @vue&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install vue using ‘npm’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am installing the project using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install -g @vue/cli&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can verify that it is properly installed by simply running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue&lt;/code&gt;, which should present you with a help message listing all available commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can run this &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vue --version&lt;/code&gt; command to know your &lt;strong&gt;vue/cli&lt;/strong&gt;  version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3. Create Vue js project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new project run this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;vue create sortoutcode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sortoutcode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is our project name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will give you the option to select, which version do you want to install &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vue 2 or Vue 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or perhaps choose the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manually select feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; option, in this article I’m using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vue 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running this command &lt;strong&gt;npm run serve&lt;/strong&gt; server is started. Now go to Browser, and run the localhost &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to open your project is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show to you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you define custom events with Vue built-in ‘emit()’ function in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$emit&lt;/code&gt; lets us emit, or send, custom events from a child component to its parent. In a standard Vue flow, this is the best way to trigger certain events (like closing a popup, for example) or to send data from a child component (like making a custom input).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the Vue Emit work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the $emit event in child components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trigger the Event in Parent Components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article guides us to &lt;strong&gt;How do I define the $emit function to trigger the event in the parent component in VueJS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation.
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Setup the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: How does the Vue Emit work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$emit()&lt;/code&gt; function call can pass with two parameters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The event name – this is the name that we can listen to in our parent component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A payload object – data that we want to pass with the event; this is optional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of a typical emit using both parameters &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$emit(&apos;event-name, data)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a different way to use Vue $emit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inline using $emit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options API – this.$emit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composition API – context.emit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Define the $emit() in child components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I’m going to set an on-click event for the the syntex is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@click&lt;/code&gt; and your function name.In Below code &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@click=&quot;childMethod&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. ‘childMethod’ is name method. we can access the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$emit()&lt;/code&gt; function in component using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword for example &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this.$emit()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$emit()&lt;/code&gt; sends an event up the component tree. In emitting () the first parameter is the method and the other one data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let us see an example of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$emit&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ChildComponent.vue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button @click&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;childMethod&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;ChildComponent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Welcome to sortoutcode.&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;childMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$emit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;get-welcome-message&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Trigger the Event in Parent Components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Parent Components, First I have to import the Child Components in the script and also export the Child Components.
After that, I am using the ‘ChildComponent’ in the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parent Component setup like this, listening for a custom &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;get-welcome-message&lt;/code&gt; event and logging its value.
And trigger the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;showMessage&lt;/code&gt; events in Parent Components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ParentComponent.vue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ChildComponent @get&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;welcome&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;message&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;showMessage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;ChildComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; ChildComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./ChildComponent.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;ParentComponent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;ChildComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ChildComponent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;showMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;*-------------*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you declare a temporary variable in vueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vue. set&lt;/strong&gt; is a tool that allows us to add a new property to an already reactive object and makes sure that this new property is ALSO reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access the veritable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will guide you to &lt;strong&gt;how do I define the temporary variable in vueJS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation.
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Setup the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Define the variable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Component &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;center&gt;&amp;lt;/center&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used to initialize the heading in the center position.
The heading &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:set=&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is used to define the new temporary variable as a property in the Html property in the template. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;center&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;set&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;title=&apos;Hi Friends, Welcome To SortoutCode!&apos;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;center&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: access the variable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can access the temporary variable in methods using the  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword. For Example use, we can access the title variable in methods &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this. title&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// I am going to access the title in methods&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Hi Friends, Welcome To SortoutCode!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Output&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;How do you define the global variable in VueJS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A global variable is a variable that is declared in the global scope in other words, a variable that is accessible from all other scopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define globle verible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access the global variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I define the global variable in VueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working on the Vue project, I need to define the global variable so I can access that variable in my project from anywhere. I am defining the variable once and using the variable multiple times in my project. To define the global variable,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation.
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sortoutcode.com/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Define globle verible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am defining the global variable using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Vue.prototype&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// declare global variable&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;$website &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;sortoutcode.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we are using this syntex &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Vue.prototype&lt;/code&gt;, for variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$website&lt;/code&gt; is your variable name. ’$’ is the very important part, $ is a convention Vue uses for properties that are available to all instances. This avoids conflicts with any defined data, computed properties, or methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Access the global variable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you want to use a global variable in your components, you have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword and the variable name.For example ‘$verible_name’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// for accessing the global variable&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;$website&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// sortoutcode.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Output&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To SortoutCode! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you set up a 404 page in vueJS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes users enter the wrong URL, instead of showing a blank page, we can show a 404 page.
So, let’s start and set up the 404 page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Vue Router&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the Components for 404 Page &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the Routes for 404 Page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will guide you to &lt;strong&gt;how do I define the Not Found page for not valid URL in vueJS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Setup the Vue (Optional)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install the Vue project, I had installed the vueJS in my system. If you haven’t installed or have any problem with installation you can follow this article, it will show you step by step process of installation.
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-setup-vuejs-project/&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;How to Install the VueJS project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Install the Vue Router&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Install the Vue router in the Vue project. For that, I am using this Command &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm I vue-router&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the installation import the vue-router into my ‘router/index.js’ file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Router &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;vue-router&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Router&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; router &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ...here your componanets, path and name&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;history&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; router&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Create the Components for 404 Page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s set up the 404 component.My 404 Component name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;NotFound.vue&lt;/code&gt;, Using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;center&gt;&amp;lt;/center&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in template we center the heading &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&gt;404 not found&amp;lt;/h1&gt;&amp;lt;h2&gt;it seems you&apos;re in the wrong page&amp;lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.In export default set the name of Components that is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;NotFound&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NotFound.vue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;center&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;404&lt;/span&gt; not found&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;it seems you&apos;re &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; the wrong page&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;center&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;NotFound&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Setup the Routes for 404 Page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have to define the router,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Vue &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Router &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vue-router&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; NotFound &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;../components/NotFound.vue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

Vue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Router&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; router &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; NotFound&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;NotFound&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we set up the path for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;NotFound.vue&lt;/code&gt; we have to just add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; in the path, if the URL does not match with another path it will render the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;NotFound.vue&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s check the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Output&lt;/h2&gt;
